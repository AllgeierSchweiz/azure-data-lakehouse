![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QgovXHHDJElg4x2NWaKMAA.jpeg)

### 1. Azure Account

To create Azure resources an Azure account needs to be created to log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

Microsoft offers the possibility to create a free Azure account with 200 USD worth of Azure credits, that can be used to provision Azure resources. This free Azure account is valid for 30 days.

### 2. Preparations

#### 2.1 Email Address

It is important you use a **personal email address** to set up this free Azure account and **not your company email**. Using your company email might cause problems due to internal company policies connected to that email account, prohibiting the use of Azure.

The account creation steps will provision a new personal email address for you.

(E.g., yournewemail@outlook.com).

#### 2.2 Phone Number

To verify your account, you will need a phone number that can receive an SMS message. This message will contain a code to activate your account.

#### 2.3 Credit or Debit Card

You will also require **a credit or debit card** to finalize the account creation.

**_NOTE:_**  **_Nothing will be charged to your card._**  **_After the USD 200 credit is used, Microsoft will ask if you want to continue with pay-as-you-go pricing, to keep using the Azure resources. You can decline this offer. Once declined, all resources will be stopped._**
